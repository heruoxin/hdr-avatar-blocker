Stop avatars from blinding you on HDR monitors.

If you have an HDR screen, you know the pain: you're browsing at night, and suddenly a small profile picture or icon glows super bright, hurting your eyes.

This extension fixes that. It dims those small images back to normal brightness, so they look just like the rest of the page.

What it does:
• Dims bright avatars: Automatically finds small images (like avatars and icons) and lowers their brightness to a comfortable level.
• You're in control: By default, it affects images smaller than 160x160 pixels. You can change this size easily with a slider.
• Safe & Open Source: Runs 100% on your computer. No data collection, no tracking. Source code: https://github.com/heruoxin/hdr-avatar-blocker

Just install and refresh your tabs.

Tip: If the "Before" and "After" images in the menu look the same to you, your monitor probably doesn't support HDR, so you don't need this.
```
